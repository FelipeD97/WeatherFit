## Description
Whether it's warm, whether it's freezing... 

This is WhetherFit. An interactive application that assists the user in picking out appropriate clothing to keep you comfortable for the elements ahead. 

We began by incorporating the Dark Sky API to pull weather data for today and tomorrow's weather. We combined this with accessible and responsive design to create a seamless experience for the user to plan ahead.
